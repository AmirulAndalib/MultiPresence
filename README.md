## Information

¬π: Requires pattern search.  
¬≤: Requires **MultiPresenceGame.exe** & **steam_api64.dll**.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> A pattern search can cause a short lag on your machine because the program is currently scanning a lot of memory to find the right address to work with.  
> Depending on the game, it can take a long time to find the address, so be patient.

<details>
<summary>CEMU</summary>
You have to disable the "Discord Presence" option found in Options -> General settings.  
</details>

The presences are always expected to work on the latest version of the game.  
Games on lower versions will never be supported on purpose. They will always use the latest version from their game store.  
If a game receives a patch, I'll do my best to update it as soon as possible.
