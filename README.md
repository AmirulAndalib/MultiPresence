## About MultiPresence
MultiPresence is designed for games that don't use Discord's "Rich Presence" feature.  
It can be extended to a wide range of games, as long as it's not too complicated to read the game's memory.  
This means that online games, especially those with anti-cheat, are less likely to be added.

## Requirements  
- Windows 10/11 64 Bit
- [.NET 6 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

## How to use it
All you have to do is run the exe and you're ready to go.  
If a game is not showing properly on discord, try running it as administrator.    

Using the context menu (right-click on the tray icon), you can easily open the config and blacklist file.  
You can also choose to launch MultiPresence with Windows, so you don't have to open it every time you switch on your PC.
 
## Blacklist (Optional)
MultiPresence also allows you to block certain games from being detected.  
As of version 1.6.0, you can use a file called "blacklist.json" to block games.  
A ready-made file and a tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/Dekirai/MultiPresence/wiki/Blacklist).

## Placeholder (Optional)
Introduced in Release 20, you can customize your presence to your liking using a config.json  
A ready-made file and a tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/Dekirai/MultiPresence/wiki/Config).

The presences are always expected to work on the latest version of the game.  
Games on lower versions will never be supported. They will always use the latest version from their game store.  
If a game receives a patch, I'll do my best to update it as soon as possible.       

Clicking on a game's name will take you to it's wiki, which contains all the features and previews.
